# configs
Various config files for my computer

Not really indended for anyone else to use, but you're more than welcome to. I just wanted a convenient place to store my configs to easily set up any other machine I'm using.

Eventually, I'll add a shell script to symlink these files throughout your home folder, but for now, you'll just have to copy the files manually.
